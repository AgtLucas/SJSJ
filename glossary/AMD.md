# AMD

[AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) stands for Asynchronous Module Definition. The API specifies a mechanism for defining modules such that the module and its dependencies can be asynchronously loaded. This is particularly well suited for the browser environment where synchronous loading of modules incurs performance, usability, debugging, and cross-domain access problems.

Perhaps the most popular implementation of AMD is [Require JS](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html) written by Mozilla's [James Burke](https://github.com/jrburke/).

AMD is an alternative to Common JS (CJS).
